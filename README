This is a very simplified version of tcpdump.
At the moment on this branch only MAC addresses are logged.
Logging is conducted in a small array.
Once the array is full, logs are dumped into 2 files:

log_dest.txt
log_source.txt

Once data is dumped, program exits.

Note that in order to run the program you need root privileges.
The reason is that program create a raw socket() in order to
capture ethernet frames. And raw socket() can be created only
by users with elevated privileges.
See packet(7) man page and here is a nice link about raw sockets:
