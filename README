This is a simple sniffer application written with libpcap.

1. For this branch libpcap is compiled preliminary from github repo and linked statically into
application.

2. Application catches only a limited number of packets set in main.c
	main.c: int cnt = 1<<5;		// num of packets to parse. -1 for infinity
	Plan to impove this unlimited in next commit

3. Only MAC addresses are captured. Plan to add IP in next commit.

4. To stop program use Ctrl-C or send it SIGINT in any other way.
